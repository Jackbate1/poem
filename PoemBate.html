  <p>A specter is left at the door. It should be the least of my worries. The lights are the true and only dancers of the night. We took the train through. The World Trade Center and saw the 9/11 memorial. It should be the least of my worries. Did I remember to lock the door?. It should be the least of my worries. Do these ghosts haunt the red, green, or yellow light. You know what I mean?.I don’t want to dance alone tonight. We are having fun. This is fun. The least of my worries.</p>
